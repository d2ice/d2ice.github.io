  - name: Deep learning for Medical Images with limited labels
    img: /assets/img/Projects/DL_medical_images.jpg
    desc: Detection of tumour from CT scans is one of the challenging problems in the medical image analysis. We aim to develop novel methods to accurately delineate tumour in limited data regime.

  - name: Applying Graph neural networks for medical image analysis
    img: /assets/img/Projects/GNN_medical.jpg
    desc: Applying GNN (Graph Neural Networks) method to learn latent features from medical image data, applying representation learning techniques for better classification and segmentation of medical images. Exploration of difference between Deep neural networks learning and Graph neural networks learning, explainablity of GNNs.

  - name: Fast identification of depressive symptomatology using probabilistic machine learning. 
    img: /assets/img/Projects/proact_edurado.jpg
    desc: Depression is an extremely common disorder, yet often not diagnosed. We aim to use Probabilistic Machine Learning to develop optimised approaches to help the specialists to identify these people, giving them the chance to access proper treatment as soon as possible.

The D<sup>2</sup>iCE medical domain spans both physical and mental health. As medical services are under resourced world-wide and our reliance and expectations on the health system are ever increasing, time and cost savings without concessions to quality of care are of the essence. Machine learning promises to meaningfully contribute to high-quality care with significant resource and cost savings, but to-date this has resulted in limited real-world applications. 
We collaborate with medical partners to ensure our innovations have the best chance of making a real impact on the lives of real patients.
