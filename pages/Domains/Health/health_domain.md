  - name: Applying Graph neural networks for medical image analysis
    img: /assets/img/thumb.png
    desc: Applying GNN (Graph Neural Networks) method to learn latent features from medical image data, applying representation learning techniques for better classification and segmentation of medical images. Exploration of difference between Deep neural networks learning and Graph neural networks learning, explainablity of GNNs.
