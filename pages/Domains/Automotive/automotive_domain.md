  - name: RadNet - Automotive detection, tracking and prediction using radar data
    img: /assets/img/Projects/Radnet_thumbnail.jpg
    desc: Radar Sensor works brilliantly in low light and adverse weather conditions, unlike other automotive sensors. This project looks at using radar data for pedestrian detection, tracking and prediction to avoid road accidents.

  - name: Vision based language tasks in Autonomous Driving 
    img: /assets/img/motor.jpg 
    desc: We aim to design a visual common-sense model that interacts with end-user in autonomous driving scenarios and answers queries on the driving decisions made by the vehicle.
