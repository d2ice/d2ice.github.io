  - name: RadNet - Automotive detection, tracking and prediction using radar data
    img: /assets/img/Projects/Radnet_thumbnail.jpg
    desc: Radar Sensor works brilliantly in low light and adverse weather conditions, unlike other automotive sensors. This project looks at using radar data for pedestrian detection, tracking and prediction to avoid road accidents.

  - name: Vision based language tasks in Autonomous Driving 
    img: /assets/img/Projects/Camera_Production_Tolerances_1.png
    desc: We aim to design a visual common-sense model that interacts with end-user in autonomous driving scenarios and answers queries on the driving decisions made by the vehicle.

The D<sup>2</sup>iCE Intelligent Transport Systems research domain covers many aspects of sensing and automation for driver assistance systems and self-driving cars. The domain area is led by [Ciarán Eising](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciaraneising/), who spent more than 12 years working in inudstry developing sensing solutions for autonomous vehicles. Machine learning has already and promises to continue to meaningfully contribute to high-quality vehicle automation. We collaborate with many companies working in the automotive sensing space, ensuring our innovations have the best chance of making a real end-user impact.
