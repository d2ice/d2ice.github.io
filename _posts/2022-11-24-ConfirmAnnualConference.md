On the 23rd and 24th of November 2022, the D²iCE group attended the [Confirm](https://confirm.ie/) Annual Conference 2022. Confirm members across Ireland were invited to the Salthill Hotel Galway to learn about the research outputs made for manufacturing for a resilient economy, society and environment. Dr. Eoin Martino Grua, of the D²iCE group researchers, was asked to present the current advancements made with the BInspect project, done in collaboration with [AMCS](https://www.amcsgroup.com/). The presentation was well received and deemed to be an excellent example of a smooth collaboration between industry and Confirm resulting in research outputs swiftly being translated to real industrial applications.
