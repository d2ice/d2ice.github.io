Eduardo was selected to represent the PhD cohort of the [SFI Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data-science.ie/) in the mid-term review of this programme. In this review, he had a chance to share his doctoral experience regarding his research, industry placement, and social interaction. One of the goals of this review was to check if the programme is performing well leading to a possible extension of the funding.
