D²iCE researchers Dr. Pepijn van de Ven and Dr. Eoin Martino Grua will start a new project, called Personae with a consortium of Danish partners funded by the Innovation Fund Denmark. In this €3 million project, Dr. Van de Ven and Dr. Grua will be responsible for the machine learning components that will allow automatic screening of patients in mental health interventions and the personalisation of treatments based on patient needs.
