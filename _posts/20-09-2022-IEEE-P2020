[IEEE P2020](https://site.ieee.org/sagroups-2020/) will shortly (in early 2023) release the ~300 page IEEE P2020 automotive imaging industry standard for automated / self-driving cars and this will be used by car companies, their suppliers, and ultimately government regulators and legislators for self-driving cars.
75 participants from the automotive, regulation, laboratory, aerospace and technology industries attended the latest Quarterly meeting in Paris, on the 19th of September. The board of the group include [Patrick Denny](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/patrickdenny), DÂ²iCE member and University of Limerick lecturer, who also acts as P2020 treasurer.
The standard body was founded as, despite all the hype, there was no agreed characterisation for the image sensing part of the chain that self-drives cars!
