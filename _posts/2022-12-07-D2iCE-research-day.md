The D²iCE research group hosted its first research day, where more than 20 researchers from the team presented on their developments over the year in 2022. Topics were varied, covering many aspects of machine learning applied to automotive sensing, imaging, mental health, circular economy, and more. A great way for the group to wrap up 2022!
