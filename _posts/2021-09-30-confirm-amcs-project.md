[CONFIRM](https://confirm.ie/) and the D<sup>2</sup>iCE Group at the University of Limerick today announced that it has started a research collaboration with [AMCS Group](https://www.amcsgroup.com/), the leading global supplier of integrated software and vehicle technology for the waste, recycling and resource industries.

This research collaboration will focus on the application of state-of-the-art technologies to the real-world challenges of waste and recycling companies worldwide who need to fully automate the recording and resolution of exceptions recorded on collection rounds like contamination of collected recyclable material and other service items (e.g., blocked service access, overloaded containers etc.)

The focus of the project is to investigate the application of key-enabling technologies frequently used in smart manufacturing environments such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Camera and Computer Vision to fully automate these processes and minimise intervention by drivers and administration staff.

The improvement of the quality of recyclables is a key foundation of the Circular Economy and one of the research objectives is to automate at scale, the identification, tracking and resolution of contaminated material close to the point of collection.

The initial project is a two-year investment and will involve a team of CONFIRM PhD researchers and academics collaborating with their AMCS counterparts.

Jimmy Martin, CEO, and co-founder of the AMCS Group said, “We are delighted to announce our collaboration with CONFIRM, a local, world-class, research centre. This application of cutting-edge technologies has the potential to automate at scale the identification and management of collection exceptions.  Innovation is at the centre of everything we do and we believe that this collaboration can deliver significant value for our customers in the areas of improving resource management, sustainability as well as margin protection. This project is a core part of our Smart City strategy where we are focused on delivering future proof solutions for tomorrow’s connected waste infrastructure.”

Prof. Conor McCarthy, Director of the CONFIRM Centre noted, “CONFIRM is delighted to be collaborating with AMCS on this innovative project that highlights the diverse nature of our research portfolio. CONFIRMS’s key focus is on the development of cutting-edge key enabling technologies such as vision systems, AI, machine learning and system integration to enhance manufacturing both in Ireland and globally, and this project is an excellent example of how our researchers, with very disparate skills, can come together with industry to solve complex problems. This project is particularly exciting as it will have a significant positive environmental impact by promoting recycling and reuse of products, thus helping create smarter supply chains that will help us realise a circular economy.”
