D²iCE members Ciarán Eising and Kaavya Rekanar are happy to announce that they will be co-organising the workshop "OmniCV: Omnidirectional Computer Vision," that will be held in conjunction with [CVPR 2023](https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/) this June in Vancouver. Head over to the [OmniCV website](https://sites.google.com/view/omnicv2023) to see more details.

We are inviting researchers who are working on this topic to submit novel research to our workshop. We accept both short (4 pages) and long (8 pages) submissions. As they are not considered dual submissions by CVPR's rules, short paper submissions can be a subset of or deeper dive into a conference submission or more extensive project. We also invite authors of relevant papers accepted to the leading conference to consider presenting their work at our workshop. Our submission deadline is on March 17, 2023. See our full [call for papers here](https://sites.google.com/view/omnicv2023/call-for-papers).

If you are actively working in this area of vision, we would love for you to consider submitting research. Regardless, we hope you will attend our workshop in Vancouver. We have some great speakers lined up: [Adrian Hilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-hilton-3a79393/) (University of Surrey), [Jongwoo Lim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jongwoolim/) (Hanyang University / MultiplEYE co. ltd.), [Jacob Roll](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-roll-b20b111/) (Qualcomm), [Robin Jenkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinjenkin/) (NVIDIA), and [Wolfgang Förstner](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/wolfgang-forstner/) (The University of Bonn).

Associated with the workshop, we have three exciting challenges, check out the [challenges page](https://sites.google.com/view/omnicv2023/challenges).
