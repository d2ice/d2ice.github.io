On May 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>, D²iCE researchers Dr. Pepijn van de Ven and Dr. Eoin Martino Grua took part in the kick-off meeting for the Personae project in Odense Denmark. D²iCE is responsible for the use of machine learning in this innovative project funded by the Innovation Fund Denmark. The project aims to use machine learning for allocation of patients to the most appropriate mental health intervention, and the subsequent personalisation of the intervention. Over two enjoyable and productive days with partners from the University of Southern Denmark, Monsenso and ’Is It A Bird’ we made exciting plans for the next four years.
